## Electric dipole field lines
This simulation was made to show (in real-time) the formation of the field lines of an electric dipole using VPython.

## Electric dipole particles interaction
This is an evolution of the previous project, were particles with different charges are affected by the electric dipole and change their trajectory accordingly.
